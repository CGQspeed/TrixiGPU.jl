- `rewrite_demo.pdf` is used as a demonstration of rewriting process
- `raw_advection_1d.jl`, `trixi_advection_1d.jl` and `rewrite_advection_1d.jl` can run successfully
- `gpu_advection_1d.jl` has been completed but not been tested yet (please refer to the file for more details)
- `sample_kernels.jl` pass all the tests for 1D, 2D, and 3D arrays
